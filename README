* Holy Chat!

A very simples chat application written in Node.js, using express (with Jade template engine) and Socket.IO.
On the client side, I used 52framework for the layout, Jquery and Jquery UI.

We are currently using this application to benchmark WebSocket vs Commet:
1) Clone project socket.io-client-benchmark
2) On it's folder, 'npm link' (as root)
3) Clone this project
4) On it's folder, 'npm install -d', and then 'npm link socket.io-client-benchmark'

Run the server: node holychat.js [transport]
* if a transport is specified, only that transport will be used.
* see socket.io client for available transports

Run the bencharm script: 'node benchmark.js 20 100 100 1000 0 0 websocket'
* run 'node benchmark.js help' for currently available parameters
* also, only websocket and xhr-polling transports are implemented

This is at a very early stage, so nothing is garanteed to work.
